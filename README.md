Simulation of a sliding window navigation algorithm

A sliding window navigation algorithm developed based on simulation environment https://github.com/Autonomous-Racing-PG/ar-tu-do

Ubuntu 16.04 and ROS kinetic is used.

[wallfollwoing.py](https://github.com/tian-cthit/little-car/blob/master/ros_ws/src/autonomous/wallfollowing2/script/wallfollowing.py) is where the algorithm is performed based on a single channel lidar.
